# Environmental_NGO_Website
This is the website which I designed and made as a challenge for an environmental NGO. 
URL : https://anweshshaw.github.io/Environmental_NGO_Website/ 
It is designed for desktop/laptop but works on mobile phones also.
This website basically demonstrates the workflow of a NGO website and how it accepts donations from people to contribute towards the greater cause of environment conservation.
